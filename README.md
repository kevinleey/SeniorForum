## How to run (in a local dev environment)

### Prerequisites
- Install NodeJS
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install` in the root directory as well as the `./client` folder

Server and client must be running simultaneously, for this you need two terminals running.
1. Server: In one terminal window, `cd` into the `/server` folder and run `npm start` to start the server.
2. Client: In another terminal window, `cd` into the `/client` folder and run `npm start` to start the client.
3. Visit `localhost:3000` to see the client in action.
